            <h2>Academy Program (Ages 9-10)</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our Academy 9U - 10U program! This program bridges the gap between recreational and select soccer, introducing players to a more competitive level of play while fostering their individual growth.</p>
            
            <h3>Program Overview</h3>
            <p>The Academy 9U/10U program is designed to provide young athletes with a challenging yet supportive environment. Our goal is to enhance their technical skills, tactical understanding, and overall love for the game. The curriculum focuses on individual player development through balanced training sessions and competitive matches.</p>

            <h3>Is Your Child Ready for Academy?</h3>
            <p>Before enrolling in our Academy program, we encourage parents to consider the following questions:</p>
            <div class="questions">
                <p class="question">Does your child have a strong understanding of soccer basics?</p>
                <p class="question">Can they effectively use both feet to dribble, pass, and shoot?</p>
                <p class="question">Are they physically fast and agile compared to their peers?</p>
                <p class="question">Do they show high levels of focus and concentration during practice and games?</p>
                <p class="question">Do they demonstrate sound technical skills such as control, dribbling, and shooting?</p>
                <p class="question">How well do they respond to coaching and guidance?</p>
            </div>
            <p>If your child has never played soccer before, we recommend starting with our recreational program. This allows them to build a solid foundation. If they showcase exceptional talent and skill, they may be invited to join the Academy program, or a waiver may be granted under special circumstances.</p>
